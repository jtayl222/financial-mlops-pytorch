# Financial MLOps PyTorch - Project Summary

## üéØ Project Purpose: Financial Direction Prediction ML Pipeline

The `src/` directory implements a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting financial market direction using PyTorch LSTM models with **breakthrough performance improvements from 52.7% to 90.2% accuracy**. The system:

- **Ingests public market data** from Yahoo Finance API for major stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, etc.) covering 2018-2023 (`data_ingestion.py`)
- **Processes financial time series data** with basic (`feature_engineering_pytorch.py`) and advanced financial indicators (`enhanced_features.py`) including MACD, Bollinger Bands, VWAP, and market microstructure features
- **Trains LSTM neural networks** with multiple variants: baseline (52.7%), enhanced (53.2%), and advanced (90.2%) using sophisticated multi-scale architecture (`advanced_financial_model.py`)
- **Provides production-ready utilities** for device management (`device_utils.py`) and MLflow integration (`mlflow_utils.py`) supporting CPU/GPU/MPS across all training scripts
- **Enables enterprise deployment** through ONNX model export, comprehensive experiment tracking, and A/B testing integration for serving on Seldon Core v2

**Algorithm**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network with 10-day sequence length for binary classification (price up/down prediction).

**Current Configuration Status**: Many settings are environment-configurable but use development defaults:
- Ticker list: Currently hardcoded to 10 major stocks, configurable via `TICKERS` env var
- Date range: Fixed 2018-2023 period, configurable via `INGESTION_START_DATE`/`INGESTION_END_DATE`
- Model variants: Three predefined configurations (baseline/enhanced/lightweight) with hardcoded hyperparameters
- Feature engineering: Fixed technical indicators (SMA windows, RSI period, lag counts)

**Enhancement Opportunities**:
- **Advanced architectures**: Transformer models show superior performance for financial time series, with ability to capture 1000+ data points of temporal dependencies and parallel processing efficiency ([MathWorks 2024](https://blogs.mathworks.com/finance/2024/02/02/deep-learning-in-quantitative-finance-transformer-networks-for-time-series-prediction/))
- **Multi-modal data**: Integrating news sentiment analysis can achieve 74.4% prediction accuracy through real-time processing of financial text ([ACM Computing Surveys 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649451))
- **Automated optimization**: Libraries like Optuna and Ray Tune provide automated hyperparameter optimization with MLOps integration, reducing manual tuning effort ([Neptune.ai 2024](https://neptune.ai/blog/best-tools-for-model-tuning-and-hyperparameter-optimization))

This creates a risk-managed approach to model deployment where different model variants can be A/B tested in production, providing measurable trade-offs between accuracy and latency for financial decision-making.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Kubernetes Platform Architecture

The `k8s/` directory defines a complete production MLOps platform built on Kubernetes with the following components:

**Infrastructure Foundation**:
- **Multi-namespace separation**: `financial-mlops-pytorch` (training) and `financial-inference` (serving) for operational isolation (`k8s/base/namespace.yaml`)
- **Seldon Core v2 Runtime**: ML model serving with hodometer, envoy, modelgateway, and mlserver components (`k8s/base/seldon-runtime.yaml`)
- **Persistent storage**: Shared data and artifacts PVCs for cross-pipeline data sharing (`k8s/base/shared-data-pvc.yaml`, `k8s/base/shared-artifacts-pvc.yaml`)
- **NGINX Ingress**: External API access with load balancing and routing (`k8s/base/nginx-ingress.yaml`)
- **Network policies**: Namespace-level security and communication controls (`k8s/base/network-policy.yaml`)

**ML Pipeline Orchestration**:
- **Argo Workflows**: Training pipeline execution with resource management (4-8Gi memory, 2-4 CPU) (`k8s/base/training-pipeline.yaml`)
- **Event-driven automation**: Sensors and event sources for triggering model training (`k8s/base/sensor.yaml`, `k8s/base/event-source.yaml`)
- **GitOps integration**: Automated model deployment through git commits (`k8s/base/training-pipeline-with-gitops.yaml`)

**A/B Testing & Model Serving**:
- **Seldon Experiments**: Traffic splitting between model variants (70/30 baseline/enhanced split) (`k8s/base/financial-predictor-ab-test.yaml`)
- **MLflow integration**: S3-based model artifact storage with URI-based model loading (`k8s/base/financial-predictor-ab-test.yaml` storageUri configuration)
- **Multi-model deployment**: Concurrent serving of baseline, enhanced, and lightweight variants (`k8s/base/mlserver.yaml`)

**Security & Resource Management**:
- **RBAC configurations**: Service account permissions for workflow execution (`k8s/base/rbac.yaml`)
- **Secret management**: Platform credentials via Kubernetes secrets (referenced in `k8s/base/training-pipeline.yaml`)
- **Resource quotas**: CPU/memory limits per training job and serving instance (`k8s/base/training-pipeline.yaml` resources section)

**Advanced Capabilities** (`k8s/advanced/`):
- **Contextual routing**: Dynamic model selection based on request context (`k8s/advanced/contextual-router.yaml`)
- **Drift monitoring**: Model performance degradation detection (`k8s/advanced/drift-monitoring.yaml`)
- **Multi-armed bandit experiments**: Automated traffic allocation optimization (`k8s/advanced/multi-armed-bandit-experiment.yaml`)
- **Explainable AI**: Model interpretation capabilities (`k8s/advanced/explainable-models.yaml`)

**Platform Deployment**: All components are orchestrated via Kustomize configuration (`k8s/base/kustomization.yaml`) with development overlays (`k8s/overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml`) for environment-specific customization.

**Scaling Opportunities**:
- **Multi-environment orchestration**: Kustomize overlays provide template-free environment management with base configurations and environment-specific patches, enabling DRY principles while maintaining YAML clarity ([Kubernetes Official Docs 2024](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/))
- **Real-time streaming**: Event-driven architecture with Knative and DAPR enables cost-efficient auto-scaling to zero during idle periods and GPU resource optimization for ML inference workloads ([Medium 2024](https://medium.com/@simardeep.oberoi/scalable-ml-inference-pipeline-project-which-involves-using-knative-ollama-llama2-and-dapr-on-715b422919a1))
- **Dynamic resource allocation**: Kubernetes HPA and VPA combination optimizes both horizontal scaling and vertical resource allocation, with AI-driven insights reducing cloud waste by up to 32% ([Komodor 2024](https://komodor.com/learn/kubernetes-autoscaling-hpa-vpa-ca-and-using-them-effectively/))

This platform enables data scientists to focus on model development while providing production-grade infrastructure for automated training, testing, and deployment of financial ML models.

## üîÑ GitOps Deployment Architecture

The `kubernetes/` directory implements GitOps-based continuous deployment using ArgoCD, providing automated infrastructure management and deployment orchestration:

**ArgoCD Application Management**:
- **Main Application**: Financial MLOps infrastructure managed as single ArgoCD application (`kubernetes/financial-mlops-application.yaml`)
- **Git-based deployment**: Automatic synchronization from GitHub repository (`https://github.com/jtayl222/financial-mlops-pytorch.git`)
- **Auto-sync policies**: Automated pruning, self-healing, and namespace creation with foreground propagation
- **Status handling**: Ignores transient status fields for Seldon Models and Experiments to prevent sync conflicts

**Component-based Deployment Structure**:
- **Argo Workflows**: Training pipeline components deployed to `financial-mlops-pytorch` namespace (`kubernetes/argo-workflows/kustomization.yaml`)
  - Includes: Training pipelines, RBAC, storage, event sources, and sensors
- **Seldon Deployments**: Model serving components deployed to `financial-inference` namespace (`kubernetes/seldon-deployments/kustomization.yaml`)
  - Includes: MLServer, Seldon runtime, A/B test experiments, VirtualServices, and network policies
- **MLflow Integration**: Placeholder for application-specific MLflow configurations (`kubernetes/mlflow/kustomization.yaml`)
  - Note: MLflow infrastructure managed by platform team separately

**GitOps Operational Benefits**:
- **Declarative infrastructure**: All platform components defined as code in git repository
- **Automated deployment**: Changes to `k8s/base/` automatically deployed to cluster
- **Rollback capabilities**: Git history provides deployment versioning and rollback options
- **Multi-environment support**: Kustomize overlays enable environment-specific configurations
- **Audit trail**: Git commits provide complete deployment history and change tracking

**Deployment Workflow**:
1. **Code changes**: Developers commit changes to `k8s/base/` directory
2. **GitOps sync**: ArgoCD detects changes and automatically applies to cluster
3. **Validation**: Automated sync policies ensure deployment consistency
4. **Health monitoring**: ArgoCD continuously monitors application health and self-heals drift

**GitOps Evolution Opportunities**:
- **Progressive deployment**: Implementing canary deployments with Argo Rollouts and blue-green strategies using Flux with Flagger, providing automated rollback capabilities and real-time monitoring for safer model rollouts ([CloudBees 2024](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/progressive-delivery-kubernetes-blue-green-and-canary-deployments))
- **Policy-as-code**: Integrating Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper for automated security compliance, providing comprehensive audit trails and policy enforcement across CI/CD pipelines with declarative Rego language ([DevOps.com 2024](https://devops.com/declarative-compliance-with-policy-as-code-and-gitops/))
- **Cross-cluster management**: Scaling GitOps across multiple environments using ArgoCD ApplicationSets and Flux hub-and-spoke architecture, enabling centralized management of workload clusters with multi-reconciler support ([AWS 2024](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/part-1-build-multi-cluster-gitops-using-amazon-eks-flux-cd-and-crossplane/))

This GitOps approach ensures that infrastructure changes are version-controlled, auditable, and automatically deployed, reducing manual deployment errors and providing reliable infrastructure management for the MLOps platform.
