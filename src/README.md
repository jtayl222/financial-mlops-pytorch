# Financial MLOps PyTorch - Source Code

## üéØ Introduction

This `src/` directory contains the complete **machine learning pipeline** for financial time series prediction using PyTorch LSTM models. The codebase demonstrates production-ready data science practices with significant model performance improvements from 52.7% to 90.2% accuracy through advanced feature engineering and architecture optimization.

The implementation showcases three distinct approaches to financial prediction: the **baseline** model represents a simple LSTM with basic technical indicators achieving 52.7% accuracy - essentially random performance for binary classification. The **enhanced** model improves upon this foundation with better hyperparameters, bidirectional processing, and optimized training strategies, reaching approximately 53-55% accuracy through architectural refinements alone. The **advanced** implementation (in `advanced_financial_model.py`) takes a comprehensive approach, combining 33 sophisticated financial features including MACD, Bollinger Bands, volatility ratios, and market microstructure indicators with a multi-scale LSTM architecture, achieving the breakthrough 90.2% accuracy that demonstrates the critical importance of domain-specific feature engineering in financial machine learning.

## üìä Performance Overview

| Model Variant | Lab Accuracy | Production Reality | Description |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Original Baseline | 52.7% | ~52.7% | Basic LSTM with simple features - near random |
| Enhanced Model | 85.2% | Degrades significantly | Advanced architecture - lab conditions only |
| **Advanced Features** | **90.2%** | Market dependent | Sophisticated features + optimized architecture |

### Reality Check Results (Post-Deployment Testing)

| Test Scenario | Accuracy | Returns | Notes |
|--------------|----------|---------|-------|
| **COVID Crash (Mar 2020)** | 57.1% | -68.6% | Significant degradation during market stress |
| **Biotech Winter (2022)** | 52.9% | +1.25% | Near-random performance, market returned +9.17% |

- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns
- **Max Drawdown**: Maximum loss from peak
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Risk/Reward**: Average win vs average loss

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Missing processed data files" Error**
   ```bash
   # Solution: Set correct data paths for local development
   export PROCESSED_DATA_DIR=data/processed
   export RAW_DATA_DIR=data/raw
   
   # Then run training
   python train_pytorch_model.py
   ```

2. **Low Accuracy (52-53%)**
   - Solution: Run `targeted_improvements.py` for advanced features
   - Ensure sufficient training data (>1000 samples)
   - Set proper environment variables first

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Reduce batch size: `BATCH_SIZE=32`
   - Use lightweight model variant
   - Enable gradient checkpointing

4. **Training Instability**
   - Enable gradient clipping
   - Reduce learning rate
   - Check for NaN values in data

### Device Support
```bash
# Force CPU usage (useful for consistency or debugging)
export FORCE_CPU=1
python train_pytorch_model.py

# Automatic device selection (default):
# - MPS: Apple Silicon GPU acceleration
# - CUDA: NVIDIA GPU acceleration  
# - CPU: Fallback for compatibility
```

The system automatically selects the best available device. All training scripts support the `FORCE_CPU` environment variable to override automatic selection and force CPU usage when needed.

## üìà Results Tracking

All training runs are tracked in MLflow with:
- Model parameters and hyperparameters
- Training metrics (loss, accuracy)
- Model artifacts (checkpoints, ONNX)
- Feature importance analysis

# Kubernetes: http://mlflow.local:30800
```

# Add custom features in enhanced_features.py
def add_custom_indicator(df, ticker):
    # Your custom logic here
    return df
```

# Define in enhanced_models.py
class CustomFinancialModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # Your architecture
