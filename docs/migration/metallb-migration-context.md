# MetalLB Migration Notes

## Background Context

### Infrastructure Change (Not Our Decision)
- **Platform team rebuilt k3s cluster** and installed MetalLB as part of infrastructure upgrade
- **Previous environment**: Flannel CNI + NodePort services
- **New environment**: Calico CNI + MetalLB LoadBalancer services
- **Our repository base branch was designed for the old environment**

### Why Platform Team Chose MetalLB

#### Operational Benefits (Inferred)
- **Stable External IPs**: LoadBalancer services get consistent external IPs vs dynamic NodePorts
- **Better DNS Integration**: LoadBalancer IPs can be registered in DNS more reliably
- **Simplified Access**: Users don't need to know node IPs + ports
- **Production Ready**: More enterprise-grade than NodePort for external services

#### Specific Services That Benefited
- **MLflow**: `192.168.1.207:5000` (was NodePort)
- **MinIO**: `192.168.1.200:9000` (was NodePort)  
- **Seldon Mesh**: `192.168.1.206:80` (was NodePort)
- **ArgoCD, Grafana, JupyterHub**: All got stable LoadBalancer IPs

## Hard Requirement vs Convenience?

### Assessment: **Convenience/Best Practice** (Not Hard Requirement)
- **Could still use NodePort**: Technical feasibility exists
- **MetalLB provides operational benefits**: Stable IPs, better UX, enterprise readiness
- **Platform team standard**: Likely part of their infrastructure standardization

### Evidence Supporting "Convenience"
1. **NodePort still works**: All services could function with NodePort + node IPs
2. **No technical blockers**: Applications don't require LoadBalancer specifically
3. **User experience improvement**: Main benefit is easier access to services
4. **Infrastructure consistency**: Platform team likely standardizing on LoadBalancer pattern

### The IP Address Management Problem
**Key Issue**: With NodePort services, IP addresses were being reassigned frequently and we couldn't easily keep our YAML files up to date.

#### NodePort Challenges
- **Dynamic Node IPs**: Node IP addresses could change during cluster maintenance
- **Port Reassignment**: NodePorts could be reassigned on service restart
- **Configuration Drift**: Environment variables and configs would become stale
- **Manual Updates**: Required constant manual updates to YAML files with new IPs/ports

#### Example of the Problem
```yaml
# This would become stale frequently
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI: http://192.168.1.105:30800  # Node IP + NodePort
MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL: http://192.168.1.107:30900  # Different node, different port
```

#### MetalLB Solution
- **Stable LoadBalancer IPs**: `192.168.1.207:5000` for MLflow remains consistent
- **Automatic DNS**: Can register stable IPs in DNS once
- **No config drift**: YAML files don't need constant IP/port updates
- **Operational reliability**: Services remain accessible at consistent endpoints

### Evidence Supporting "Best Practice"
1. **DNS integration**: LoadBalancer IPs can be registered in internal DNS
2. **Security boundary**: LoadBalancer provides cleaner network boundary than node access
3. **Monitoring integration**: Easier to monitor and alert on service availability
4. **Multi-cluster patterns**: LoadBalancer services work better in multi-cluster setups

## Impact on Our Application

### What Changed for Us
- **Environment variables**: MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI, AWS_S3_ENDPOINT URLs updated to LoadBalancer IPs
- **Network policies**: Had to account for LoadBalancer ingress traffic patterns
- **Service discovery**: No longer dependent on knowing node IPs and ports
- **Documentation**: Had to update all connection examples and troubleshooting guides

### What Stayed the Same
- **Application logic**: No code changes required
- **Storage patterns**: Still using same S3/MLflow patterns
- **Model training**: Argo workflows unchanged
- **Model serving**: Seldon Core functionality identical

## Conclusion

**MetalLB solved a real operational pain point** with NodePort IP/port management while providing additional infrastructure benefits. The key driver was:

### Primary Problem Solved
- **Configuration maintenance burden**: Constantly updating YAML files with changing NodePort IPs/ports
- **Operational reliability**: Services becoming unreachable due to IP/port changes
- **Automation challenges**: Hard to script or automate against changing endpoints

### Secondary Benefits  
- Better user experience (stable IPs)
- Improved operational characteristics (DNS, monitoring)
- More enterprise-ready external service access

**Assessment**: While technically a "convenience," the IP address management problem made MetalLB a **practical necessity** for maintaining reliable, automated MLOps operations. The migration was about **solving operational pain** and adapting our configurations to more stable infrastructure patterns.
