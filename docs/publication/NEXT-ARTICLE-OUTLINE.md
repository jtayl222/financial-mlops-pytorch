# A/B Testing in Production MLOps: Real-World Model Comparison at Scale

*The next article in the Enterprise MLOps series*

## Article Overview

This article demonstrates how to implement sophisticated A/B testing for machine learning models in production, using a financial forecasting platform built with Kubernetes, Seldon Core v2, and Argo Workflows. We'll show how to safely compare model variants, measure business impact, and make data-driven deployment decisions.

## Key Themes

1. **Production-Ready A/B Testing**: Beyond simple traffic splitting
2. **Business Impact Measurement**: Connecting model performance to revenue
3. **Risk Management**: Safe experimentation in production environments
4. **Automated Decision Making**: Using data to drive deployment choices

## Article Structure

### Introduction: The Model Deployment Dilemma
- Challenge: How do you safely deploy new model versions in production?
- Traditional approach: Blue-green deployments (all-or-nothing)
- Modern approach: Gradual rollouts with A/B testing
- Why A/B testing matters for ML models specifically

### The Business Case for ML A/B Testing

#### Traditional Software A/B Testing vs ML A/B Testing
- **Traditional**: UI changes, conversion rates, user behavior
- **ML**: Model accuracy, prediction quality, business metrics
- **Key Difference**: ML models have both performance AND business implications

#### Real-World Example: Financial Forecasting
- **Baseline Model**: 78.5% accuracy, 45ms latency
- **Enhanced Model**: 82.1% accuracy, 62ms latency
- **Business Question**: Is 3.6% accuracy improvement worth 17ms latency?

### Technical Implementation

#### Seldon Core v2 Experiment Configuration
```yaml
apiVersion: mlops.seldon.io/v1alpha1
kind: Experiment
metadata:
  name: financial-ab-test-experiment
spec:
  candidates:
  - name: baseline-predictor
    weight: 70
  - name: enhanced-predictor  
    weight: 30
  default: baseline-predictor
```

#### Traffic Distribution Strategy
- **70/30 Split**: Conservative approach for financial models
- **Gradual Ramp**: Start with 5% enhanced, increase based on results
- **Fallback**: Automatic revert if enhanced model fails

### The A/B Testing Pipeline

#### 1. Model Training and Registration
```python
# Train multiple model variants
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/financial-training-pipeline-template \
  -p model-variant=baseline -n financial-mlops-pytorch

argo submit --from workflowtemplate/financial-training-pipeline-template \
  -p model-variant=enhanced -n financial-mlops-pytorch
```

#### 2. Automated Model Deployment
```python
# GitOps-driven deployment
./scripts/gitops-model-update.sh enhanced
```

#### 3. Experiment Execution
```python
# Run comprehensive A/B test
python3 scripts/advanced-ab-demo.py --endpoint "http://seldon-mesh" \
  --scenarios 2500 --workers 5
```

### Real-World Results Analysis

#### Performance Metrics Deep Dive

**Traffic Distribution:**
- Baseline Model: 1,661 requests (66.4%)
- Enhanced Model: 839 requests (33.6%)

**Response Time Analysis:**
- Baseline: 52ms avg, 80ms P95
- Enhanced: 71ms avg, 109ms P95
- **Impact**: +19ms average (+36.5% latency increase)

**Accuracy Comparison:**
- Baseline: 78.5% accuracy
- Enhanced: 82.1% accuracy  
- **Impact**: +3.6 percentage points improvement

#### Business Impact Calculation

**Revenue Impact Formula:**
```
Revenue Lift = Accuracy Improvement × Revenue Multiplier
Revenue Lift = 3.6% × 0.5 = 1.8%
```

**Cost Impact Formula:**
```
Cost Impact = Latency Increase × Infrastructure Multiplier
Cost Impact = 19ms × 0.1 = 1.9%
```

**Net Business Value:**
```
Net Value = Revenue Lift - Cost Impact + Risk Reduction
Net Value = 1.8% - 1.9% + 2.0% = 1.9%
```

### Advanced A/B Testing Patterns

#### 1. Multi-Armed Bandit Approach
```python
# Dynamic traffic allocation based on performance
if enhanced_model.accuracy > baseline_model.accuracy + threshold:
    increase_traffic_to_enhanced()
else:
    maintain_current_split()
```

#### 2. Contextual Bandits
```python
# Route traffic based on market conditions
if market_volatility > 0.3:
    route_to_robust_model()
else:
    route_to_accurate_model()
```

#### 3. Staged Rollouts
```python
# Gradual deployment strategy
stages = [
    {"enhanced_traffic": 5, "duration": "1 hour"},
    {"enhanced_traffic": 15, "duration": "4 hours"},
    {"enhanced_traffic": 30, "duration": "24 hours"},
    {"enhanced_traffic": 100, "duration": "production"}
]
```

### Monitoring and Observability

#### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response time (mean, P95, P99)
   - Throughput (requests/second)
   - Error rate
   - Model accuracy

2. **Business Metrics**
   - Revenue per prediction
   - Cost per prediction
   - Risk-adjusted returns
   - Customer satisfaction

3. **Operational Metrics**
   - Resource utilization
   - Deployment success rate
   - Rollback frequency
   - Time to detect issues

#### Alerting Strategy
```yaml
# Example alert configuration
alerts:
  - name: model_accuracy_degradation
    condition: enhanced_model.accuracy < baseline_model.accuracy - 0.02
    action: automatic_rollback
  
  - name: latency_threshold_breach
    condition: p95_latency > 150ms
    action: traffic_reduction
```

### Risk Management in Production

#### 1. Automatic Safeguards
```python
# Implement circuit breakers
if enhanced_model.error_rate > 0.05:
    route_all_traffic_to_baseline()
```

#### 2. Gradual Rollback
```python
# Intelligent rollback strategy
if business_impact < threshold:
    gradually_reduce_enhanced_traffic()
```

#### 3. Chaos Engineering
```python
# Test model resilience
simulate_model_failure()
verify_fallback_behavior()
```

### Production Best Practices

#### 1. Experiment Design
