# A/B Testing in Production MLOps: Real-World Model Comparison at Scale

*How to safely deploy ML models with data-driven confidence*

## The Model Deployment Dilemma

You've spent months training a new machine learning model. It shows 3.6% better accuracy in offline evaluation. Your stakeholders are excited. But here's the million-dollar question: **How do you safely deploy this model to production without risking your business?**

Traditional software deployment strategies fall short for ML models:

- **Blue-green deployments** are all-or-nothing: you risk everything on untested production behavior
- **Canary releases** help with infrastructure, but don't measure model-specific performance
- **Shadow testing** validates infrastructure but doesn't capture business impact

This is where **A/B testing for ML models** becomes essential.

## Why A/B Testing is Different for ML Models

Unlike traditional A/B testing (which focuses on UI changes and conversion rates), ML A/B testing requires measuring:

| Traditional A/B Testing | ML A/B Testing |
|------------------------|----------------|
| User conversion rates | Model accuracy |
| Click-through rates | Prediction latency |
| Revenue per visitor | Business impact per prediction |
| UI engagement | Model confidence scores |

**The key difference**: ML models have both *performance* and *business* implications that must be measured simultaneously.

## Our Real-World Example: Financial Forecasting

In this article, we'll demonstrate enterprise-grade A/B testing using a financial forecasting platform built with:

- **Kubernetes** for orchestration
- **Seldon Core v2** for model serving and experiments
- **Prometheus** for metrics collection
- **Grafana** for visualization
- **Argo Workflows** for training pipelines

### The Challenge

We have two models:
- **Baseline Model**: 78.5% accuracy, 45ms latency
- **Enhanced Model**: 82.1% accuracy, 62ms latency

**Business Question**: Is 3.6% accuracy improvement worth 17ms latency increase?

Let's find out through production A/B testing.
