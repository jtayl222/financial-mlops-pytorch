# Implementation: Running Production A/B Tests

## The A/B Testing Pipeline

Our implementation follows a structured approach to ensure reliable results:

### 1. Model Training and Registration

```bash
# Train baseline model
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/financial-training-pipeline-template \
  -p model-variant=baseline \
  -p data-version=v2.3.0 \
  -n financial-mlops-pytorch

# Train enhanced model
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/financial-training-pipeline-template \
  -p model-variant=enhanced \
  -p data-version=v2.3.0 \
  -n financial-mlops-pytorch
```

### 2. Model Deployment via GitOps

```bash
# Update model URIs in Git
./scripts/gitops-model-update.sh enhanced v1.2.0

# Argo CD automatically deploys changes
kubectl get models -n financial-inference
```

### 3. Experiment Execution

```python
# Advanced A/B testing with real-time metrics
python3 scripts/advanced-ab-demo.py \
  --endpoint "http://192.168.1.202:80" \
  --scenarios 2500 \
  --workers 5 \
  --metrics-port 8002
```

## Real-World Results Analysis

### Test Configuration
- **Duration**: 2 hours 15 minutes
- **Total Requests**: 2,500
- **Traffic Split**: 70% baseline, 30% enhanced
- **Market Conditions**: Mixed (bull/bear/sideways/volatile)

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Baseline Model | Enhanced Model | Difference |
|--------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| **Requests Processed** | 1,851 (74.0%) | 649 (26.0%) | - |
| **Success Rate** | 98.8% | 99.1% | +0.3% |
| **Average Response Time** | 51ms | 70ms | +19ms |
| **P95 Response Time** | 79ms | 109ms | +30ms |
| **Model Accuracy** | 78.5% | 82.1% | +3.6% |
| **Error Rate** | 1.2% | 0.8% | -0.4% |

### Business Impact Calculation

```python
# Revenue impact calculation
accuracy_improvement = 82.1 - 78.5  # 3.6 percentage points
revenue_lift = accuracy_improvement * 0.5  # 1.8% (0.5% per 1% accuracy)

# Cost impact calculation  
latency_increase = 70 - 51  # 19ms
cost_impact = latency_increase * 0.1  # 1.9% (0.1% per ms)

# Risk reduction calculation
error_rate_improvement = 1.2 - 0.8  # 0.4 percentage points
risk_reduction = error_rate_improvement * 10  # 4.0%

# Net business value
net_value = revenue_lift - cost_impact + risk_reduction
# Net value = 1.8% - 1.9% + 4.0% = 3.9%
```

## Key Findings

### 1. Performance Trade-offs
- **Enhanced model** shows significantly better accuracy (+3.6%)
- **Latency cost** is substantial (+19ms average, +30ms P95)
- **Reliability improvement** with lower error rate

### 2. Business Impact
- **Revenue lift**: +1.8% from accuracy improvement
- **Cost impact**: -1.9% from latency increase
- **Risk reduction**: +4.0% from improved reliability
- **Net business value**: +3.9%

### 3. Traffic Distribution
- Actual traffic split: 74% baseline, 26% enhanced
- Small deviation from target (70/30) due to natural variance
- No significant impact on results

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Real-time Metrics Collection

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge

# Request metrics
request_counter = Counter('ab_test_requests_total', 
                         'Total requests', 
                         ['model_name', 'status'])

# Response time metrics
response_time_histogram = Histogram('ab_test_response_time_seconds',
                                   'Response time distribution',
                                   ['model_name'])

# Business metrics
business_impact_gauge = Gauge('ab_test_business_impact',
                             'Business impact metrics',
                             ['model_name', 'metric_type'])
```

### Automated Alerts

```yaml
# High response time alert
- alert: HighResponseTime
  expr: histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(ab_test_response_time_seconds_bucket[5m])) > 0.200
  for: 3m
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "High response time detected for {{ $labels.model_name }}"

# Accuracy degradation alert
- alert: ModelAccuracyDegraded
  expr: ab_test_model_accuracy < 75
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "Model accuracy dropped below 75%"
```

## Decision Framework

Based on our results, we use this decision matrix:

| Net Business Value | Accuracy Improvement | Recommendation |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| > 2% | Any | ✅ **STRONG RECOMMEND** |
| 0.5% - 2% | > 2% | ✅ **RECOMMEND** |
| 0.5% - 2% | < 2% | ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** |
| < 0.5% | Any | ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED** |

**Our Result**: Net business value of +3.9% with +3.6% accuracy improvement

**Recommendation**: ✅ **STRONG RECOMMEND** - Deploy enhanced model

*The data clearly shows that despite the latency cost, the enhanced model provides significant business value through improved accuracy and reliability.*
