## Financial Impact Analysis

### Revenue Model

In financial trading, model accuracy directly impacts profitability:

```python
# Revenue calculation
base_trading_volume = 10_000_000  # $10M daily volume
accuracy_improvement = 0.036      # 3.6 percentage points
revenue_multiplier = 0.005        # 0.5% revenue per 1% accuracy

daily_revenue_increase = (
    base_trading_volume * 
    accuracy_improvement * 
    revenue_multiplier
)
# Daily increase: $1,800
# Annual increase: $657,000
```

### Cost Model

Higher latency increases infrastructure and opportunity costs:

```python
# Cost calculation
latency_increase = 0.019         # 19ms increase
requests_per_day = 50_000        # Daily request volume
cost_per_ms = 0.0001            # $0.0001 per ms per request

daily_cost_increase = (
    requests_per_day * 
    latency_increase * 
    cost_per_ms * 
    1000  # Convert to milliseconds
)
# Daily increase: $95
# Annual increase: $34,675
```

### Risk Reduction Value

Lower error rates reduce trading losses:

```python
# Risk calculation
error_rate_improvement = 0.004   # 0.4 percentage points
average_loss_per_error = 500     # $500 per error
daily_requests = 50_000

daily_risk_reduction = (
    daily_requests * 
    error_rate_improvement * 
    average_loss_per_error
)
# Daily reduction: $100
# Annual reduction: $36,500
```

| **Cost Increase** | -$95 | -$34,675 |
| **Risk Reduction** | +$100 | +$36,500 |
| **Net Daily Value** | +$1,805 | +$658,825 |

### Infrastructure Investment

| Component | One-time Cost | Annual Cost |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **A/B Testing Infrastructure** | $15,000 | $5,000 |

### ROI Analysis

```python
# ROI calculation
annual_benefit = 658_825
annual_cost = 53_000
initial_investment = 78_000

first_year_roi = (annual_benefit - annual_cost - initial_investment) / initial_investment
# First year ROI: 575%

ongoing_roi = (annual_benefit - annual_cost) / annual_cost
# Ongoing ROI: 1,143%
```
