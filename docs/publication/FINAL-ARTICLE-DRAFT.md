# A/B Testing in Production MLOps: Real-World Model Comparison at Scale

*How to safely deploy ML models with data-driven confidence*

---

## The Model Deployment Dilemma

You've spent months training a new machine learning model. It shows 3.6% better accuracy in offline evaluation. Your stakeholders are excited. But here's the million-dollar question: **How do you safely deploy this model to production without risking your business?**

Traditional software deployment strategies fall short for ML models:

- **Blue-green deployments** are all-or-nothing: you risk everything on untested production behavior
- **Canary releases** help with infrastructure, but don't measure model-specific performance
- **Shadow testing** validates infrastructure but doesn't capture business impact

This is where **A/B testing for ML models** becomes essential.

## Why A/B Testing is Different for ML Models

Unlike traditional A/B testing (which focuses on UI changes and conversion rates), ML A/B testing requires measuring:

| Traditional A/B Testing | ML A/B Testing |
|------------------------|----------------|
| User conversion rates | Model accuracy |
| Click-through rates | Prediction latency |
| Revenue per visitor | Business impact per prediction |
| UI engagement | Model confidence scores |

**The key difference**: ML models have both *performance* and *business* implications that must be measured simultaneously.

## Our Real-World Example: Financial Forecasting

In this article, we'll demonstrate enterprise-grade A/B testing using a financial forecasting platform built with:

- **Kubernetes** for orchestration
- **Seldon Core v2** for model serving and experiments
- **Prometheus** for metrics collection
- **Grafana** for visualization
- **Argo Workflows** for training pipelines

### The Challenge

We have two models:
- **Baseline Model**: 78.5% accuracy, 45ms latency
- **Enhanced Model**: 82.1% accuracy, 62ms latency

**Business Question**: Is 3.6% accuracy improvement worth 17ms latency increase? In our business, every 1% accuracy improvement drives 0.5% revenue, but every 10ms of latency adds 1% to operational costs. This is the trade-off we need to solve.

## Technical Architecture: Production-Ready A/B Testing

### System Overview

Our A/B testing infrastructure follows GitOps principles with full observability:

```

### Seldon Core v2 Deployment Details

Our production cluster runs the following Seldon Core v2 components (Helm releases):

| Release Name              | Namespace      | Status    | Chart Version         | App Version |
|-------------------------- |---------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| seldon-core-v2-crds       | seldon-system  | deployed  | seldon-core-v2-crds-2.9.0    | 2.9.0      |
| seldon-core-v2-runtime    | seldon-system  | deployed  | seldon-core-v2-runtime-2.9.0 | 2.9.0      |
| seldon-core-v2-servers    | seldon-system  | deployed  | seldon-core-v2-servers-2.9.0 | 2.9.0      |
| seldon-core-v2-setup      | seldon-system  | deployed  | seldon-core-v2-setup-2.9.0   | 2.9.0      |


### Seldon Core v2 Experiment Configuration

The heart of our A/B testing is a Seldon Experiment resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: mlops.seldon.io/v1alpha1
kind: Experiment
metadata:
  name: financial-ab-test-experiment
  namespace: financial-ml
spec:
  default: baseline-predictor
  candidates:
    - name: baseline-predictor
      weight: 70
    - name: enhanced-predictor
      weight: 30
  mirror:
    percent: 100
    name: traffic-mirror
```

**Key features:**
- **70/30 traffic split**: Conservative approach for financial models
- **Default fallback**: Automatic routing to baseline if enhanced fails
- **Traffic mirroring**: Copy requests for offline analysis

### Prometheus Metrics Collection

We collect comprehensive metrics for both models:

```python
# Request metrics
ab_test_requests_total{model_name="baseline-predictor",status="success"} 1851
ab_test_requests_total{model_name="enhanced-predictor",status="success"} 649

# Response time distribution
ab_test_response_time_seconds_bucket{model_name="baseline-predictor",le="0.05"} 1245
ab_test_response_time_seconds_bucket{model_name="enhanced-predictor",le="0.05"} 523

# Model accuracy
ab_test_model_accuracy{model_name="baseline-predictor"} 78.5
ab_test_model_accuracy{model_name="enhanced-predictor"} 82.1

# Business impact
ab_test_business_impact{model_name="enhanced-predictor",metric_type="net_business_value"} 3.3
```

## Implementation: Running Production A/B Tests

### The A/B Testing Pipeline

```bash
# 1. Train models
argo submit --from workflowtemplate/financial-training-pipeline-template \
  -p model-variant=enhanced -p data-version=v2.3.0

# 2. Deploy via GitOps
./scripts/gitops-model-update.sh enhanced v1.2.0

# 3. Run A/B test
python3 scripts/advanced-ab-demo.py --scenarios 2500 --workers 5
```

### Real-World Results Analysis

**Test Configuration:**
- Duration: 2 hours 15 minutes
- Total Requests: 2,500
- Traffic Split: 70% baseline, 30% enhanced

**Performance Results:**

| Metric | Baseline Model | Enhanced Model | Difference |
|--------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| **Requests Processed** | 1,851 (74.0%) | 649 (26.0%) | - |
| **Success Rate** | 98.8% | 99.1% | +0.3% |
| **Average Response Time** | 51ms | 70ms | +19ms |
| **P95 Response Time** | 79ms | 109ms | +30ms |
| **Model Accuracy** | 78.5% | 82.1% | +3.6% |
| **Error Rate** | 1.2% | 0.8% | -0.4% |

### Business Impact Calculation

```python
# Revenue impact (0.5% revenue per 1% accuracy improvement)
accuracy_improvement = 82.1 - 78.5  # 3.6 percentage points
revenue_lift = accuracy_improvement * 0.5  # 1.8%

# Cost impact (0.1% cost per ms latency increase)
latency_increase = 70 - 51  # 19ms
cost_impact = latency_increase * 0.1  # 1.9%

# Risk reduction (10x multiplier for error rate improvement)
error_rate_improvement = 1.2 - 0.8  # 0.4 percentage points
risk_reduction = error_rate_improvement * 10  # 4.0%

# Net business value
net_value = revenue_lift - cost_impact + risk_reduction
# Net value = 1.8% - 1.9% + 4.0% = 3.9%
```

**Key Findings:**
- **Revenue lift**: +1.8% from accuracy improvement
- **Cost impact**: -1.9% from latency increase
- **Risk reduction**: +4.0% from improved reliability
- **Net business value**: +3.9%

**Recommendation**: ✅ **STRONG RECOMMEND** - Deploy enhanced model

## Business Case: Measuring ROI

### Financial Impact Analysis

**Revenue Model:**
```python
base_trading_volume = 10_000_000  # $10M daily volume
accuracy_improvement = 0.036      # 3.6 percentage points
revenue_multiplier = 0.005        # 0.5% revenue per 1% accuracy

daily_revenue_increase = base_trading_volume * accuracy_improvement * revenue_multiplier
# Daily increase: $1,800 | Annual: $657,000
```

**Cost Model:**
```python
latency_increase = 0.019         # 19ms increase
requests_per_day = 50_000        # Daily requests
cost_per_ms = 0.0001            # $0.0001 per ms per request

daily_cost_increase = requests_per_day * latency_increase * cost_per_ms * 1000
# Daily increase: $95 | Annual: $34,675
```

### ROI Calculation

## Key Takeaways and Best Practices

### Technical Insights

1. **A/B Testing Infrastructure is Critical** - Traditional deployments are insufficient for ML models
2. **Business Impact Measurement is Complex** - Multiple factors must be considered together
3. **Observability Drives Confidence** - Real-time monitoring enables fast decisions

### Production Best Practices

**Experiment Design:**
```python
experiment_plan = {
    "hypothesis": "Enhanced model improves accuracy by 3%+",
    "success_criteria": {
        "primary": "net_business_value > 2%",
        "secondary": "p95_latency < 200ms",
        "guardrail": "error_rate < 2%"
    },
    "traffic_allocation": {"baseline": 70, "enhanced": 30},
    "duration": "48 hours minimum"
}
```

**Automated Decision Making:**
```python
def make_deployment_decision(metrics):
    net_value = metrics['net_business_value']
    if net_value > 2.0:
        return "STRONG_RECOMMEND"
    elif net_value > 0.5:
        return "RECOMMEND"
    else:
        return "CONTINUE_TESTING"
```
