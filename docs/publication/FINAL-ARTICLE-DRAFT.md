# A/B Testing in Production MLOps: Real-World Model Comparison at Scale

*How to safely deploy ML models with data-driven confidence*

---

## About This Open Source Demonstration

This article describes a fully operational, open-source demonstration of an MLOps workflow for A/B testing financial models. The entire system was built from the ground up to serve as a portfolio piece, showcasing a deep, practical understanding of modern MLOps principles.

It is composed of two distinct but connected projects:

#### 1. The MLOps Platform (Infrastructure)
The underlying infrastructure is a complete, production-ready MLOps platform built on Kubernetes (K3s). It provides all the core services needed for a robust MLOps environment.

*   **Repository:** [**github.com/jtayl222/ml-platform**](https://github.com/jtayl222/ml-platform)
*   **Features:** Experiment tracking (MLflow), model serving (Seldon Core), pipeline orchestration (Argo Workflows), GitOps (Argo CD), and comprehensive monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana).

#### 2. The Financial ML Application (This Project)
This repository contains the machine learning application that **runs on top of the platform**. It includes the ML code, training pipelines, and deployment manifests to solve a specific business problem.

*   **Repository:** [**github.com/jtayl222/financial-mlops-pytorch**](https://github.com/jtayl222/financial-mlops-pytorch)
*   **Features:** Demonstrates how a real ML application leverages the underlying platform to achieve automated training, versioning, deployment, and advanced A/B testing.

Together, these two repositories demonstrate the crucial separation of concerns between the MLOps platform and the ML application, a key principle in building scalable and maintainable machine learning systems.

## The Model Deployment Dilemma

You've spent months training a new machine learning model. It shows 3.6% better accuracy in offline evaluation. Your stakeholders are excited. But here's the million-dollar question: **How do you safely deploy this model to production without risking your business?**

Traditional software deployment strategies fall short for ML models:

- **Blue-green deployments** are all-or-nothing: you risk everything on untested production behavior
- **Canary releases** help with infrastructure, but don't measure model-specific performance
- **Shadow testing** validates infrastructure but doesn't capture business impact

This is where **A/B testing for ML models** becomes essential.

## Why A/B Testing is Different for ML Models

Unlike traditional A/B testing (which focuses on UI changes and conversion rates), ML A/B testing requires measuring:

| Traditional A/B Testing | ML A/B Testing |
|------------------------|----------------|
| User conversion rates | Model accuracy |
| Click-through rates | Prediction latency |
| Revenue per visitor | Business impact per prediction |
| UI engagement | Model confidence scores |

**The key difference**: ML models have both *performance* and *business* implications that must be measured simultaneously.

## Our Real-World Example: Financial Forecasting

In this article, we'll demonstrate enterprise-grade A/B testing using a financial forecasting platform built with:

- **Kubernetes** for orchestration
- **Seldon Core v2** for model serving and experiments
- **Prometheus** for metrics collection
- **Grafana** for visualization
- **Argo Workflows** for training pipelines

### The Challenge

We have two models:
- **Baseline Model**: 78.5% accuracy, 45ms latency
- **Enhanced Model**: 82.1% accuracy, 62ms latency

**Business Question**: Is 3.6% accuracy improvement worth 17ms latency increase? In our business, every 1% accuracy improvement drives 0.5% revenue, but every 10ms of latency adds 1% to operational costs. This is the trade-off we need to solve.

### Seldon Core v2 Deployment Details

Our production cluster runs the following Seldon Core v2 components (Helm releases):

| Release Name              | Namespace      | Status    | Chart Version         | App Version |
|-------------------------- |---------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| seldon-core-v2-crds       | seldon-system  | deployed  | seldon-core-v2-crds-2.9.0    | 2.9.0      |
| seldon-core-v2-runtime    | seldon-system  | deployed  | seldon-core-v2-runtime-2.9.0 | 2.9.0      |
| seldon-core-v2-servers    | seldon-system  | deployed  | seldon-core-v2-servers-2.9.0 | 2.9.0      |
| seldon-core-v2-setup      | seldon-system  | deployed  | seldon-core-v2-setup-2.9.0   | 2.9.0      |


### Seldon Core v2 Experiment Configuration

The heart of our A/B testing is a Seldon Experiment resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: mlops.seldon.io/v1alpha1
kind: Experiment
metadata:
  name: financial-ab-test-experiment
  namespace: financial-inference
spec:
  default: baseline-predictor
  candidates:
    - name: baseline-predictor
      weight: 70
    - name: enhanced-predictor
      weight: 30
  mirror:
    percent: 100
    name: traffic-mirror
```

**Key features:**
- **70/30 traffic split**: Conservative approach for financial models
- **Default fallback**: Automatic routing to baseline if enhanced fails
- **Traffic mirroring**: Copy requests for offline analysis

### Prometheus Metrics Collection

We collect comprehensive metrics for both models:

```python
# Request metrics
ab_test_requests_total{model_name="baseline-predictor",status="success"} 1851
ab_test_requests_total{model_name="enhanced-predictor",status="success"} 649

# Response time distribution
ab_test_response_time_seconds_bucket{model_name="baseline-predictor",le="0.05"} 1245
ab_test_response_time_seconds_bucket{model_name="enhanced-predictor",le="0.05"} 523

# Model accuracy
ab_test_model_accuracy{model_name="baseline-predictor"} 78.5
ab_test_model_accuracy{model_name="enhanced-predictor"} 82.1

# Business impact
ab_test_business_impact{model_name="enhanced-predictor",metric_type="net_business_value"} 3.3
```

### Real-World Results Analysis

**Test Configuration:**
- Duration: 2 hours 15 minutes
- Total Requests: 2,500
- Traffic Split: 70% baseline, 30% enhanced

**Performance Results:**

| Metric | Baseline Model | Enhanced Model | Difference |
|--------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| **Requests Processed** | 1,851 (74.0%) | 649 (26.0%) | - |
| **Success Rate** | 98.8% | 99.1% | +0.3% |

### Business Impact Calculation

```python
# Revenue impact (0.5% revenue per 1% accuracy improvement)
accuracy_improvement = 82.1 - 78.5  # 3.6 percentage points
revenue_lift = accuracy_improvement * 0.5  # 1.8%

# Cost impact (0.1% cost per ms latency increase)
latency_increase = 70 - 51  # 19ms
cost_impact = latency_increase * 0.1  # 1.9%

# Risk reduction (10x multiplier for error rate improvement)
error_rate_improvement = 1.2 - 0.8  # 0.4 percentage points
risk_reduction = error_rate_improvement * 10  # 4.0%

# Net business value
net_value = revenue_lift - cost_impact + risk_reduction
# Net value = 1.8% - 1.9% + 4.0% = 3.9%
```

**Key Findings:**
- **Revenue lift**: +1.8% from accuracy improvement
- **Cost impact**: -1.9% from latency increase
- **Risk reduction**: +4.0% from improved reliability
- **Net business value**: +3.9%

## Business Case: Measuring ROI

### Financial Impact Analysis

**Revenue Model:**
```python
base_trading_volume = 10_000_000  # $10M daily volume
accuracy_improvement = 0.036      # 3.6 percentage points
revenue_multiplier = 0.005        # 0.5% revenue per 1% accuracy

daily_revenue_increase = base_trading_volume * accuracy_improvement * revenue_multiplier
# Daily increase: $1,800 | Annual: $657,000
```

**Cost Model:**
```python
latency_increase = 0.019         # 19ms increase
requests_per_day = 50_000        # Daily requests
cost_per_ms = 0.0001            # $0.0001 per ms per request

daily_cost_increase = requests_per_day * latency_increase * cost_per_ms * 1000
# Daily increase: $95 | Annual: $34,675

## Appendix: A Deep Dive into the Project

For those interested in the specifics of the implementation, this section provides additional context on the data, code, and future potential of this project.

### Data Source and Feature Engineering

The model is trained on historical stock market data sourced dynamically from **Yahoo Finance** using the `yfinance` library.

1.  **Data Ingestion:** The `src/data_ingestion.py` script downloads daily price data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) for a predefined list of stock tickers (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, GOOG).
2.  **Feature Engineering:** The `src/feature_engineering_pytorch.py` script creates a rich feature set from the raw data, including:
    *   **Lagged Features:** Past values of price and volume.
    *   **Technical Indicators:** Simple Moving Averages (SMA) and Relative Strength Index (RSI).
    *   **Daily Returns:** Percentage change in closing price.
3.  **Target Variable:** The modeling task is a **binary classification** problem: predict whether the closing price will go **up (1)** or **down (0)** on the next day.
4.  **Data Splitting:** The data is split chronologically into training, validation, and test sets to prevent lookahead bias.

### Python Implementation and Model Architecture

The Python implementation in the `src/` directory is solid, modular, and follows good software engineering practices, separating concerns for data ingestion, feature engineering, model definition, and training.

*   **Model:** The core model, defined in `src/models.py`, is a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network built with PyTorch. This architecture is well-suited for learning patterns in sequential time-series data.
*   **Training:** The `src/train_pytorch_model.py` script handles the end-to-end training loop, including class weighting to handle imbalanced data, MLflow integration, and comprehensive evaluation.
*   **Serving:** The model is exported to the ONNX format for high-performance, interoperable serving with Seldon Core's MLServer.

### Future Roadmap: Towards a Real-World System

This project provides a strong foundation. To build this out into a truly production-grade financial prediction system, the following steps would be next:

1.  **Incorporate More Complex Data Sources:**
    *   Integrate alternative data like SEC filings (EDGAR), market news sentiment (using NLP), or macroeconomic indicators.
    *   Move from daily data to intraday (minute-level) data for more granular predictions.

2.  **Evolve the Model Architecture:**
    *   **Attention Mechanisms:** Enhance the LSTM with attention layers to allow the model to focus on more influential parts of the time-series.
    *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Model the relationships between different stocks as a graph to capture market-wide dependencies.

3.  **Implement Advanced Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Feature Store:** Integrate a feature store like Feast to provide consistent, versioned features for both training and real-time inference.

4.  **Systematic Hyperparameter Tuning:**
    *   Integrate an automated hyperparameter optimization framework like **Optuna** or **Ray Tune**, orchestrated by Argo Workflows.

5.  **Enhance Model Explainability and Trust:**
    *   Incorporate model explainability tools like **SHAP** or **Captum** to understand *why* the model is making certain predictions, which is critical for building trust in finance.
