# GitOps Setup with Argo CD

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED**: This document has been consolidated into:
> - **Primary Reference**: `CLAUDE.md` (GitOps Workflow section)
> - **Quick Commands**: `docs/operations/quick-reference.md` (GitOps with Argo CD section)
>
> This file is kept for historical reference but is no longer maintained.

## Migration Notice

The GitOps setup documentation has been moved to reduce documentation fragmentation:

### New Locations:
- **GitOps Workflow**: See `CLAUDE.md` → "GitOps Workflow" section
- **Argo CD Commands**: See `docs/operations/quick-reference.md` → "GitOps with Argo CD" section
- **Architecture Details**: See `CLAUDE.md` → "Architecture Overview" section

### What Was Moved:
- Argo CD application structure → `quick-reference.md`
- Access instructions (Web UI, CLI) → `quick-reference.md`
- Key commands and workflow → `quick-reference.md`
- Security considerations → `CLAUDE.md`
- Best practices → `CLAUDE.md`

For the most up-to-date GitOps procedures, always refer to `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/operations/quick-reference.md`.
