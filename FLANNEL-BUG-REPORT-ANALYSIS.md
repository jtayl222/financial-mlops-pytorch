‚úì CNI plugin configuration and logs  
‚úì Container runtime network namespace inspection
‚úì Flannel daemon logs and configuration
‚úì Cross-platform behavior comparison (Calico, etc.)
```

## **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Minimal Reproduction (2-3 days)**
```yaml
# Environment Setup:
Day 1:
- Fresh K3s cluster deployment
- Minimal test pod creation
- Initial failure documentation

# Network Investigation:
Day 2:  
- tcpdump evidence collection
- iptables rules analysis
- CNI configuration examination

# Cross-Platform Testing:
Day 3:
- kubeadm + Flannel comparison
- Different Flannel backend testing
- Calico baseline establishment
```

#### **Minimal Test Case Design**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: flannel-intra-pod-test
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: server
    image: busybox:1.35
    command: 
    - sh
    - -c
    - "echo 'Starting server on 127.0.0.1:8080' && nc -l -p 8080"
  - name: client
    image: busybox:1.35  
    command:
    - sh
    - -c
    - "sleep 10 && echo 'Connecting to localhost:8080' && nc 127.0.0.1 8080"

# Expected: client connects to server via localhost
# Actual: connection refused with Flannel VXLAN
```

### **Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis (2-3 days)**
```bash
# Deep Investigation Areas:
1. Flannel source code review (CNI plugin implementation)
2. CNI bridge plugin behavior analysis
3. Container runtime network namespace isolation  
4. K3s-specific networking modifications
5. Comparison with working CNI implementations

# Expected Technical Findings:
- Specific Flannel configuration causing isolation
- CNI plugin ordering or configuration issues
- Network namespace permission restrictions
- Container runtime integration problems
```

### **Phase 3: High-Quality Report Creation (1-2 days)**
```markdown
# Bug Report Structure (GitHub Issue):

## üêõ Bug Report: Intra-pod localhost connectivity fails with Flannel VXLAN

### Summary
Containers within the same pod cannot communicate via localhost (127.0.0.1) 
when using Flannel with VXLAN backend, despite proper service binding.

### Environment
- **Kubernetes**: v1.32.5 (K3s distribution)
- **Flannel**: v0.22.0 
- **Container Runtime**: containerd 2.0.5-k3s1
- **CNI**: flannel + bridge plugin
- **Backend**: VXLAN

### Reproduction Steps
[Minimal test case with exact kubectl commands]

### Expected Behavior
Container A binds to 127.0.0.1:8080 ‚Üí Container B connects to 127.0.0.1:8080

### Actual Behavior
Connection refused despite successful binding (verified via external access)

### Network Analysis
[Detailed tcpdump output, iptables rules, CNI logs]

### Comparison Testing
- ‚úÖ Works with Calico CNI
- ‚úÖ Works with hostNetwork: true  
- ‚ùå Fails with Flannel VXLAN
- ‚úÖ Works with Flannel host-gw (if confirmed)

### Impact
Affects multi-container applications requiring intra-pod communication
(databases, application servers, sidecars, service meshes)

### Workarounds
1. Use alternative CNI (Calico)
2. Use hostNetwork: true (security implications)
3. Use pod IP instead of localhost (application changes required)
