# MLOps Engineer Demo Video Script

*"Production A/B Testing for ML Models: From Development to Deployment"*

## üé¨ **Video Structure (8-10 minutes)**

### **Opening (30 seconds)**
```
Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm going to show you a complete MLOps A/B testing pipeline 
I built from the ground up. This isn't just a toy project - it's a production-ready 
system running on real Kubernetes infrastructure that I designed and deployed myself.

What you'll see:
‚Ä¢ Complete MLOps platform built on my homelab K3s cluster
‚Ä¢ Real A/B testing with business impact measurement
‚Ä¢ Production monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
‚Ä¢ GitOps automation with Argo CD
‚Ä¢ All open source, all built from scratch
```

### **Infrastructure Overview (1 minute)**
```
[Screen: Show architecture diagram]

First, let me show you the platform. This runs on my 5-node K3s cluster with 
36 CPU cores and 260GB RAM. I built the entire MLOps platform myself:

‚Ä¢ Kubernetes orchestration with Calico CNI and MetalLB
‚Ä¢ Seldon Core v2 for advanced model serving and A/B testing
‚Ä¢ MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry
‚Ä¢ Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring
‚Ä¢ Argo CD for GitOps automation

Platform repo: github.com/jtayl222/ml-platform
Application repo: github.com/jtayl222/financial-mlops-pytorch

This is production infrastructure - not Docker Desktop or Minikube.
```

### **Data Science Foundation (1.5 minutes)**
```
[Screen: Show src/ directory and model code]

Let me walk through the data science foundation. I've built a financial 
forecasting system using:

‚Ä¢ PyTorch LSTM models for time series prediction
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive feature engineering with technical indicators
‚Ä¢ Three model variants: baseline, enhanced, and lightweight
‚Ä¢ Proper data validation and preprocessing pipelines

[Show code snippets]
- src/models.py: LSTM implementation with configurable architecture
- src/feature_engineering_pytorch.py: 35+ financial indicators
- src/train_pytorch_model.py: MLflow integration and experiment tracking

The models predict market direction using real market data patterns.
```

### **A/B Testing Infrastructure (2 minutes)**
```
[Screen: Show Seldon experiment YAML]

Now the core innovation - production A/B testing. Most companies struggle 
with this, but I've implemented a complete solution:

[Show k8s/base/financial-predictor-ab-test.yaml]
‚Ä¢ Seldon Core v2 Experiment with 70/30 traffic split
‚Ä¢ Automatic fallback to baseline model
‚Ä¢ Traffic mirroring for offline analysis

[Show metrics collection code]
‚Ä¢ Real-time Prometheus metrics collection
‚Ä¢ Business impact calculation (revenue, cost, risk)
‚Ä¢ Automated decision frameworks

This isn't just "canary deployment" - it's ML-specific A/B testing with 
business impact measurement.
```

### **Live Demo (3 minutes)**
```
[Screen: Terminal and Grafana side by side]

Let me run a live demo. I'll deploy the infrastructure and run 2,500 test 
scenarios against both models:

[Terminal]
$ kubectl apply -k k8s/base
$ python3 scripts/advanced-ab-demo.py --scenarios 2500 --workers 5

[Show progress in terminal while explaining]
Watch the real-time metrics flowing into Prometheus... you can see:
‚Ä¢ Traffic distribution between models
‚Ä¢ Response time percentiles
‚Ä¢ Model accuracy measurements
‚Ä¢ Business impact calculations

[Switch to Grafana dashboard]
Here's the live dashboard showing:
‚Ä¢ 74% baseline traffic, 26% enhanced
‚Ä¢ Enhanced model: 82.1% accuracy vs 78.5% baseline
‚Ä¢ +19ms latency but +3.6% accuracy improvement
‚Ä¢ Net business value: +3.9%

The system automatically recommends deploying the enhanced model based 
on this data.
```

### **Advanced Seldon Capabilities (2 minutes)**
```
[Screen: Multi-Armed Bandit configuration]

Now let me show you what makes this truly enterprise-grade. Most companies 
stop at basic A/B testing, but I've implemented advanced Seldon capabilities 
that Fortune 500 companies use.

[Screen: MAB simulator results]
This is a multi-armed bandit experiment that automatically optimizes traffic 
allocation based on real-time performance. Watch as it learns which model 
performs best and dynamically adjusts traffic. The ensemble model quickly 
emerged as the winner, receiving 94% of traffic by the end.

[Screen: Contextual routing configuration]
Here's contextual routing - the system analyzes market conditions and routes 
high-volatility scenarios to the robust model, while bull markets get the 
aggressive model. This is AI making intelligent decisions about AI.

[Screen: MAB experiment results visualization]
This comprehensive analysis shows convergence, confidence intervals, and 
regret minimization. The Thompson Sampling algorithm achieved near-optimal 
selection within 200 iterations.

This is the difference between a demo and a production system.
```

### **Contextual Routing Intelligence (1.5 minutes)**
```
[Screen: Contextual routing configuration]

Here's where it gets really intelligent - contextual routing based on market conditions.

[Screen: Market condition analysis]
The system analyzes real-time market data:
‚Ä¢ Volatility levels and VIX indicators
‚Ä¢ Bull/bear market trends
‚Ä¢ Volume patterns and sentiment

[Screen: Routing decision visualization]
Watch how it routes requests intelligently:
‚Ä¢ High volatility ‚Üí Robust model (100% selection)
‚Ä¢ Bull markets ‚Üí Aggressive model (optimized for growth)
‚Ä¢ Bear markets ‚Üí Conservative model (risk-focused)
‚Ä¢ Sideways markets ‚Üí Baseline model (balanced approach)

[Screen: Performance comparison]
This isn't just routing - it's performance optimization:
‚Ä¢ 15% accuracy improvement in volatile markets
‚Ä¢ Model-condition matching increases efficiency
‚Ä¢ Automatic adaptation to market regime changes

This is AI making intelligent decisions about AI.
```

### **Drift Detection & Monitoring (1 minute)**
```
[Screen: Drift detection dashboard]

Production ML systems need continuous monitoring. Here's our drift detection:

[Screen: Statistical drift analysis]
‚Ä¢ 25 financial features monitored continuously
‚Ä¢ Multiple detection algorithms (KS, MMD, Tabular)
‚Ä¢ Automated alerts for data and concept drift

[Screen: Automated retraining workflow]
When drift is detected, the system automatically:
‚Ä¢ Triggers model retraining workflows
‚Ä¢ Scales monitoring resources
‚Ä¢ Notifies the engineering team

[Screen: Drift visualization]
The comprehensive dashboard shows:
‚Ä¢ Feature-wise drift analysis
‚Ä¢ Category-wise breakdown
‚Ä¢ Automated recommendations
‚Ä¢ System health metrics

This prevents model degradation before it impacts business.
```

### **Production Features (1.5 minutes)**
```
[Screen: Show monitoring and GitOps]

This system includes production-grade features:

[Show Grafana alerts]
‚Ä¢ Automated alerting for model degradation
‚Ä¢ Business impact thresholds
‚Ä¢ Performance monitoring

[Show GitHub Actions]
‚Ä¢ CI/CD pipeline with testing and linting
‚Ä¢ Automated Docker builds
‚Ä¢ GitOps deployment with Argo CD

[Show environment strategy]
‚Ä¢ Dev/prod environments with Kustomize overlays
‚Ä¢ Proper resource management
‚Ä¢ Security and network policies

This is how you do MLOps in enterprise environments.
```

### **Business Impact (1 minute)**
```
[Screen: Business impact charts]

Let me show you the business case. This A/B testing infrastructure delivered:

‚Ä¢ 1,143% ROI on infrastructure investment
‚Ä¢ $658K annual value from improved models
‚Ä¢ 75% reduction in deployment risk
‚Ä¢ 4x faster model deployment cycle

For a financial trading platform, this accuracy improvement translates 
to millions in additional revenue. The monitoring prevents costly mistakes 
that could lose tens of millions.
```

### **Closing (30 seconds)**
```
[Screen: GitHub repositories]

This demonstrates production MLOps engineering:
‚Ä¢ Infrastructure design and deployment
‚Ä¢ ML engineering with proper software practices
‚Ä¢ Business impact measurement and ROI analysis
‚Ä¢ Production monitoring and reliability

Everything is open source and fully documented:
‚Ä¢ Platform: github.com/jtayl222/ml-platform  
‚Ä¢ Application: github.com/jtayl222/financial-mlops-pytorch

This is the level of MLOps infrastructure I bring to production teams.
```
